\title{Create a forest plot and table of coefficients and stats from one or more regression models.}
\usage{
forestplot(
  ...,
  modelnames = NULL,
  varnames = NULL,
  stats = NULL,
  odds.ratio = F,
  breaks = NULL,
  intercept = T,
  facet = T,
  dodgewidth = 0.3,
  sig = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more model objects.}

\item{modelnames}{A character vector of names to label each plot and table column.}

\item{varnames}{A named character vector. Each element is a human friendly version of the variable name, and each name is the original variable name.}

\item{stats}{A named list of numeric vectors. The names are the names of the stats; the vectors are the stats to include in the table.}

\item{odds.ratio}{If TRUE, apply exponential transform to coefficients and omit intercept.}

\item{breaks}{An optional vector of breaks for the plot x-axis.}

\item{intercept}{If TRUE, include the intercept in the table and plot; otherwise omit.}

\item{facet}{If TRUE, display models in different facets. Otherwise, distinguish by color.}

\item{dodgewidth}{For position_dodge(). Default = 0.3.}

\item{sig}{The number of signficant digits for the table.}
}
\value{
A named list. $plot has the plot. $table has the data frame of coefficients and stats.
